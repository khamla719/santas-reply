        <h1>Dear River,</h1>
        <p>Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas! It's wonderful to hear from you. I'm so pleased to know that you've been a good boy this year. Remember, everyone can be a little bit naughty sometimes, but what's important is trying your best to be kind and thoughtful.</p>
        <p>I've checked my list, and guess what? You're definitely on the 'Nice' list! I'm happy you've asked for a sports game for your Nintendo Switch. The elves and I will do our best to make sure you get a fun game to enjoy. Maybe you'll become a sports champion in your game!</p>
        <p>Keep being good, River. Remember to listen to your parents, be kind to others, and always try your hardest at whatever you do. That's the true spirit of Christmas!</p>
        <p>Merry Christmas and lots of love,</p>
        <p><strong>Santa Claus 🎅🎄🎁</strong></p>
